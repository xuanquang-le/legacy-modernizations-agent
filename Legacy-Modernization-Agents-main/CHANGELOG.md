## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **GitHub Copilot SDK Provider** — New `ServiceType=GitHubCopilot` option uses the `GitHub.Copilot.SDK` NuGet package and `CopilotChatClient` as an alternative to Azure OpenAI. All agents fall back to `IChatClient` when `ResponsesApiClient` is unavailable. Configuration requires only `AISETTINGS__MODELID`; endpoint and API key are ignored.
- **`list-models` CLI Command** — `dotnet run -- list-models` enumerates models available to the authenticated GitHub Copilot user via the SDK.
- **Interactive Provider Selection in `doctor.sh setup`** — Users choose between Azure OpenAI and GitHub Copilot SDK. The Copilot path verifies CLI presence, authenticates via `copilot login`, fetches available models, and writes `ai-config.local.env`.
- **`CreateGitHubCopilotChatClient()` in `ChatClientFactory`** — Factory method for `CopilotChatClient`; `CreateChatClient()` accepts a `serviceType` parameter to route to the correct backend.

### Changed
- **`ResponsesApiClient` made nullable** — `MigrationProcess`, `ChunkedMigrationProcess`, and `SmartMigrationOrchestrator` accept `null` for the Responses API client. All agent construction is dual-pathed (Responses API vs `IChatClient`).
- **Dynamic provider name in logging** — `AgentBase.ProviderName`, `CobolAnalyzerAgent.ProviderName`, and `ChatLogger` display "GitHub Copilot" or "Azure OpenAI" based on the active client type.
- **`doctor.sh` diagnostics** — `check_ai_connectivity()`, `run_doctor()`, and `run_test()` detect `GitHubCopilot` service type, validate the Copilot CLI, and skip Azure-specific endpoint/deployment checks.
- **`Config/load-config.sh`** — `validate_config()` short-circuits for `GitHubCopilot`, requiring only `AISETTINGS__MODELID`.
- **Devcontainer** — Base image updated to `.NET 10.0`; installs `@github/copilot@latest` (Copilot CLI); adds `github-cli` feature; Node pinned to v22.

### Fixed
- **`generate_migration_report()` in `doctor.sh`** — Changed SQLite `.mode markdown` to `.mode list` to produce correct report output.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Business Logic Persistence** — `ReverseEngineeringProcess` and `ChunkedReverseEngineeringProcess` now persist extracted `BusinessLogic` records to a new `business_logic` SQLite table via `IMigrationRepository.SaveBusinessLogicAsync`. Added `GetBusinessLogicAsync` and `DeleteBusinessLogicAsync` to `IMigrationRepository`, `SqliteMigrationRepository`, and `HybridMigrationRepository`.
- **Business Logic Injection into Conversion Prompts** — All four converter agents (`JavaConverterAgent`, `CSharpConverterAgent`, `ChunkAwareJavaConverter`, `ChunkAwareCSharpConverter`) now receive extracted `BusinessLogic` records via `SetBusinessLogicContext()` (new method on `ICodeConverterAgent`). In full-pipeline runs, `SmartMigrationOrchestrator` wires RE output directly into conversion; `--reuse-re` loads the same context from a previous persisted RE run. A shared `FormatBusinessLogicContext()` helper in `AgentBase` formats the context for all four converters.
- **`--reuse-re` CLI flag** — When combined with `--skip-reverse-engineering`, loads business logic from the latest persisted RE run and injects it into conversion prompts. `doctor.sh convert-only` now prompts interactively for this choice.
- **REST API: `GET/DELETE /api/runs/{runId}/business-logic`** — Returns per-file business logic summary (story/feature/rule counts); DELETE removes persisted results to allow re-running RE for that run.
- **Portal: per-run `🔬 RE Results` button** — Shows the business logic summary table for a run and allows deletion of persisted results directly from the UI.
- **RE Results in Portal Chat** — Chat endpoint injects business purpose, user stories, features, and business rules from the `business_logic` table into the AI prompt context. Updated AI system prompt accordingly.

### Fixed
- **Empty Technical Analysis in RE output** — `ReverseEngineeringProcess` and `ChunkedReverseEngineeringProcess` now fall back to rendering `RawAnalysisData` when structured `CobolAnalysis` fields are unpopulated.
- **Total Features always 0** — `BusinessLogicExtractorAgent.ExtractFeatures()` now matches `### Use Case N:` and `### Operation` headings in addition to `### Feature:`, reflecting the actual AI prompt output.

### Changed
- **Dependency mapping runs once per full run** — RE processes (`ReverseEngineeringProcess`, `ChunkedReverseEngineeringProcess`) now include a dedicated dependency mapping step (step 4/5) and store the result on `ReverseEngineeringResult.DependencyMap`. `MigrationProcess` and `ChunkedMigrationProcess` accept a `SetDependencyMap()` call and skip `AnalyzeDependenciesAsync` when a map is already provided. `SmartMigrationOrchestrator.RunAsync` threads `existingDependencyMap` through to both migration paths. Dependency output files (`dependency-map.json`, `dependency-diagram.md`) are now generated in the RE output folder as well as the migration output folder.
- **`doctor.sh`** — Updated `convert-only` to prompt for `--reuse-re`; corrected portal navigation references to match current UI (`'📄 Reverse Engineering Results'`).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Automated Documentation Checker** — New GitHub Actions workflow (`documentation-updater`) that reviews code changes on every push and PR to `main`, identifies missing or outdated documentation, and notifies the responsible author via PR comments or issues.
- **Speed Profile Selection** - New interactive prompt in `doctor.sh` lets you choose between four speed profiles before running migrations, reverse engineering, or conversion-only:
  - **TURBO** — Low reasoning on ALL files with no exceptions. 65K token ceiling, parallel file conversion (4 workers), 200ms stagger delay. Designed for testing and smoke runs where speed matters more than quality.
  - **FAST** — Low reasoning on most files, medium only on the most complex ones. 32K token cap, parallel conversion (3 workers), 500ms stagger. Good for quick iterations and proof-of-concept runs.
  - **BALANCED** (default) — Uses the three-tier content-aware reasoning system. Simple files get low effort, complex files get high effort. Parallel conversion (2 workers), 1s stagger.
  - **THOROUGH** — Maximum reasoning on all files regardless of complexity. Parallel conversion (2 workers), 1.5s stagger. Best for critical codebases where accuracy matters more than speed.
- **Shared `select_speed_profile()` function** — Called from `run_migration()`, `run_reverse_engineering()`, and `run_conversion_only()`. Sets `CODEX_*` environment variables that are picked up by `Program.cs` `OverrideSettingsFromEnvironment()` at startup — no C# changes needed.
- **Adaptive Re-Chunking on Output Exhaustion** — When reasoning exhaustion retries fail (all escalation attempts exhausted), `AgentBase` now automatically splits the COBOL source at the best semantic boundary (DIVISION > SECTION > paragraph > midpoint) and processes each half independently with a 50-line context window (second half begins 50 lines before the split point for continuity). Results are merged with duplicate package/import/class removal and validated for truncation signals. This solves the TURBO/FAST paradox where small output token caps caused repeated exhaustion failures rather than triggering the existing input-size-based chunking.
- **Parallel File Conversion** — All 4 converter agents (`ChunkAwareJavaConverter`, `ChunkAwareCSharpConverter`, `JavaConverterAgent`, `CSharpConverterAgent`) now support parallel file conversion via `SemaphoreSlim`-based concurrency control. Controlled by `MaxParallelConversion` setting (default: 2). TURBO uses 4 workers, FAST uses 3, BALANCED/THOROUGH use 2.
- **Environment Variable Overrides for Timing** — New env vars `CODEX_STAGGER_DELAY_MS`, `CODEX_MAX_PARALLEL_CONVERSION`, and `CODEX_RATE_LIMIT_SAFETY_FACTOR` allow fine-tuning of parallelism and rate limiting without code changes.

### Fixed
- **Settings Injection Bug** — All agent constructors in `MigrationProcess.cs`, `ChunkedMigrationProcess.cs`, and `Program.cs` were missing the `settings` parameter, causing `AppSettings` to always be `null` inside agents. As a result, runtime configuration (including environment variable overrides such as `CODEX_MAX_PARALLEL_CONVERSION`) could not be applied, and agents fell back to the default `MaxParallelConversion` value of 1 (sequential). All 10 constructor call sites now pass `settings` correctly so both static config and env var overrides take effect as intended.
- **Hardcoded Rate Limit Safety Margin** — `RateLimitTracker.SafetyMargin` was hardcoded at 0.90, ignoring the configurable `RateLimitSafetyFactor` from `ChunkingSettings`. Now accepts a `safetyMargin` parameter wired from settings (TURBO=0.85, default=0.70).

### Changed
- **README.md** — Added Speed Profile documentation with profile comparison table
- **doctor.sh** — Added `select_speed_profile()` function and integrated into all three run commands. TURBO/FAST profiles now export parallel conversion and stagger delay env vars.
- **TokenHelper.cs** — `CalculateRequestDelay` delay floor lowered from hardcoded 15s to configurable (default 2s, minimum 500ms)
- **ChunkingSettings.cs** — Added `MaxParallelConversion` property (default 1)
